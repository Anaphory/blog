# On ’s, better, and anti-disestablishmentarianism.

Sounds (more precisely: [phonemes](PhonemeFrequencies)) are the underlying
building blocks of words. A word that sounds different can mean something
different. But a single /l/ doesn't yet mean anything. There is a growing body
of literature on motivated associations between sounds and meanings, like
onomatopoeia (cuckoo), ideophones (zigzag), or sound symbolism (eg. the tendency
of words for ‘tiny’ to have /i/s in them), but that's not the point here.

So, what's the smallest thing that actually means something? In English, ⟨a⟩ /ə/
seems to be a good candidate. That *is** a single sound, but it's not like that
sound always has that meaning. Otherwise we would have quite a problem with
⟨sever***a**l⟩!

## I don't actually have a quantitative question for this article yet.
