# (Un)Natural languages
Why do we study languages? For one, it's in itself a really fascinating subject.
Every human [(okay, 99.9% of all humans, at
least)](https://neuroanthropology.net/2010/07/21/life-without-language/) has
access to at least one language. And encoutering more than one language and
playing with language (be it puns or poetry) are also pretty universal.

In addition, language is closely connected to many other aspects of human
cognition, human evolution, and human culture. At least indirectly, it is
therefore interesting for figuring out the human condition what's common to all
languages, and how broad the diversity is.

What then should we count as ‘language’? The acccepted more specific term for
our targets is **natural languages**. I cannot give you a water-tight
definition, because there are always edge cases which we can talk about in
detail, and each of those edge-cases may be useful for some linguistic research,
but outside the scope for others.

In general, we are talking about structured systems of human communication that
are learned and evolve through social interaction. At the core, natural
languages are either spoken or signed – but of course we could also sing,
whistle, dance, make patterns in each others' hands. Or, like here, write
language.

What then does this definition exclude?

## Not natural languages

### Animal communication systems
The first obvious thing we are *not* interested in are animal communication
systems. The various call structures of birds, primates, whales, the social
communication (verbal and non-verbal) of apes, and all the communication systems
further afield (be they vocal, chemical, visual, or tactile) of various species
can be relevant as baseline to compare the minimal communicative properties of
any human language with. If we want to understand what is common to all human
languages, it can naturally be useful to look at what it contrasts with in other
animals.

As such, it won't keep me from discussing animal communication systems if I find
interesting quantitative tidbits about them. But that's not a focus of
linguistics or this blog.

### Programming languages
Programming languages have expressive structure and are a system for humans to
communicate tasks to a computer, and the histories of their evolution may be
scientifically interesting (compare
http://www.pfnp.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/programming-language-history2.png,
http://www.aistudy.com/program/images/programming_language_family_tree.gif), but
their structure is so much informed by the machines in addition to the humans
using them that it would be really hard figure out anything about humanity from
them. I bet it's not impossible – languages for comparable computing tasks can
totally tell us about human cognition by being easier or more difficult to learn
and use. But if we want to understand humans, we better study something that's
not just a bunch of ones and zeros.

Oh, you mean the brain is just a bunch of neurons firing spikes (ones) with gaps
between them (zeros) to other neurons? Okay. I lied. To understand humans, we
better pick something that has co-evolved with them for more than a single
generation.

### Constructed languages
For a similar reason, designed languages are not that interesting to
linguistics. Admittedly, sometimes linguists develop small ‘languages’ with
particular features to use in experiments. Such a synthetic language might then
for example measure whether those features make it easier or harder to learn the
languages. But in this case, the synthetic language is not the object of study,
but a tool that the linguist can manipulate in order to investigate some feature
that is not accessible for direct study. Because they are often used in
quantitative contexts, they may well re-appear in the future.

But beyond that, people have been inventing languages for fun or other reasons:
These languages are generally known as ‘conlangs’, for [‘constructed
languages’](). Most conlangs fall in one of three categories.

1. To be used in communication between people who do not share a common native
   language. These ‘international auxiliary languages’ or ‘auxlangs’ can have a
   few native speakers – Esperanto has been around for a few generations now, so
   people have studied it. But overall, auxlangs have so little traction and
   evolutionary history that they hardly matter. The big exception is where an
   auxlang is built with some feature which is interesting for linguists and
   rare in natural languages, because then the fact that this ‘expanded
   synthetic language’ already has speakers, maybe even native speakers, can be
   useful.
2. The classical examples for conlangs are made for works of fiction: Films and
   series in particular contain their share of invented languages (Klingon,
   Avatar, Arrival). But conlangs with an artistic purpose, ‘artlangs’, don't
   need fiction. Sometimes they are not a late addition, but the seed of a work
   of fiction. The most famous of these are probably Tolkien's languages: the
   Quenya and Sindarin of the elves as well as the Khuzdul of dwarves and his
   extensive thoughts on the relationships between them and all the other
   languages of his Middle Earth. They came with several books' worth of story
   because in Tolkien's mind, a fictional language needed a fictional history.
   <-- Tolkien was of the opinion that the invention of an artistic language in
   order to be convincing and pleasing must include not only the language's
   historical development, but also the history of its speakers, and especially
   the mythology associated with both the language and the speakers. It was this
   idea that an "Elvish language" must be associated with a complex history and
   mythology of the Elves that was at the core of the development of Tolkien's
   legendarium. Tolkien wrote in one of his letters: "what I think is a primary
   'fact' about my work, that it is all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic
   in inspiration. ... It is not a 'hobby', in the sense of something quite
   different from one's work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of
   languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a
   world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the
   story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course,
   such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much
   'language' has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I
   now find that many would have liked more.) ... It is to me, anyway, largely
   an essay in 'linguistic aesthetic', as I sometimes say to people who ask me
   'what is it all about'." [T 5] --> Whether with a lot of history or with
   barely any: Artlangs are less an input to linguistics and more an outcome.
3. The third type of constructed languages are languages engineered with some
   design goal, like unambiguity, expressing formal logic, or making assumptions
   about sentence structure that don't occur in human languages. They are like
   elaborate thought experiments concerning the nature of natural languages.

Some conlangs fit into categorical overlaps. In particular, languages for
fictional aliens are often engineered with particular non-human features in
mind, but go beyond thought experiments to acquire their own cultural contexts,
with their own histories and quirks, all fictional.

## Edge Cases

There are some edge cases worth mentioning: Whistled modes of languages, ritual
languages and other cases of a limited domain language.

## Natural with a twist

### Sign languages

Sign languages, of which there are probably hundreds worldwide, are definitely
natural languages. But because of their different modality (and historically,
the false assumption that being unable to use spoken language efficiently would
be an indication of lack of intelligence – see the unfortunate double meaning of
dumb), sign languages are often excluded from linguistic generalizations. This
has somewhat changed in recent years, so there is hope that sign languages will
get the linguistic attention they deserve in the future.

As Deaf people organized themselves in national associations, and countries
started founding or supporting schools for deaf children where sign languages
would be at least tolerated or better yet used as medium of instruction,
individual sign languages have become associated with education systems and
therefore countries, so now there is, in the median, about one sign language per
country, with a complicated pattern of historical relationships between them.
Some countries might have no sign languages beyond home sign, because they do
not support their deaf people and no local communities with high proportions of
deaf exist. Other countries may have several sign languages, eg. because of the
structures of schools for the Deaf (eg. Switzerland has Swiss German Sign
Language and its own dialects of the French and Italian Sign Languages, in
parallel with the major languages of instruction in the federal country), or
because there are local Deaf communities (eg. villages with high congenital
deafness or Deaf laborers in big cities – or in schools that refuse to use sign
language as medium of instruction).

### Large, Literate, Official Languages
Writing is by far not the normal state of existance of languages, though. For a
start, writing is only maybe 4000 years old, and became a wide-spread cultural
technique only in the last few hundred years (and in some places isn't yet).
This makes the written mode of language atypical. In fact, there are indications
that being a written language – in particular a ‘large, literate, official
language’ – even has an influence on the structure of the language.

## A typical natural language

So what does a typical natural language look like – not in terms of its content
but according to its community? And how many languages are there?

To answer these questions, we need to first clear some terminology – so far we
have talked about what ‘natural language’ is, now we need to sort out what ‘*a*
natural language’ is, as opposed to a different natural language. The important
– and somewhat impossible – distinction here is the one between a language and a
dialect.

An old aphorism says “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy”, but
political boundaries are only one aspect that can drive dialects apart to become
different languages. The general consensus for distinguishing two related
languages from two dialects of a common language is mutual intelligibility.
[Glottolog](http://glottolog.org), a comprehensive bibliography-annotated
catalog about the languages of the world, phrases its criterion for including a
‘languoid’ (i.e. a language, dialect, language family, slang, etc.) as separate
language like this:

> For any alleged language to be considered in the classification we must first
> determine whether it was distinct from all other languages. By distinct, we
> mean not mutually intelligible with any other language. In principle, any
> convincing evidence to this effect is sufficient. For example, direct
> comparison of language data or testimonies of non-intelligibility to all
> neighbouring languages is the most straightforward kind of evidence. But also,
> various types of evidence for isolation from all other humans for a long time
> could make a convincing case that a language is indeed distinct from all
> others. [1]
> [1]: https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation#inclusionexclusionoflanguages

There are two issues which make this definition have a huge number of edge cases.

1. Mutual intelligibility is a scale, not a clear cut. As native German speaker
   who grew up in the north-west of the country, I may be able to do my
   groceries in a Swiss farm shop, but I am hard-pressed to understand a
   discussion of current political events. Are my native variety of German and
   the local Swiss German now mutually intelligible or not?
2. Mutual intelligibility is not transitive: Western Dutch may be clearly
   mutually intelligible with Eastern Dutch, which in turn may be mutually
   intelligible with North-Western Low German, which may be mutually
   understandable with my native variety, and so on in a chain of mutual
   intelligibility reaching down to the Swiss German of Valais. Yet Dutch and
   Valais German are clearly not mutually intelligible.

I will address this issue of language versus dialect in a future post, for now
let me assume that the linguists collating the existing language catalogues have
an internally consistent way to operate and make the distinction. There are two
major such catalogs: In addition to the research-based
[Glottolog](http://glottolog.org) I mentioned above, the Christian missionary
charity SIL International maintains the
[Ethnoloɠue](https://www.ethnologue.com/) catalog of languages of the world and
the ISO 639-3 language codes.
