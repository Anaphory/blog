# Language diversification

Imagine a landscape, dotted with settlements of people speaking a common
language. There is no long-range communication, no writing, and no way to get
from one place to another faster than on foot or by paddling in a boat. How
long, do you think, until we could tell which settlement someone is from by the
way they speak? A generation, maybe? How long until the people from one end of
the landscape don't understand the people from the other end any more?

The answer probably depends on a lot of factors, but in particular it depends on
the mobility of people and the connectedness of the settlements. (And, of
course, on what we mean by ‘don't understand each other any more’, but [that's a
different story.](MutualIntelligibility.md)). <!-- We might see such effects in
the victims of civil wars or ethnic violence leading to forced displacement, but
luckily it doesn't appear academics have taken additional advantage of such
already unfortunate people. --> To investigate questions like this, simulation
studies are a useful tool. We can create realistic landscapes or landscapes with
specific properties in a simulation and run through several thousand years of
language evolution in a single night. The issue is this: How do we build a model
of this process that contains all the necessary components for language
evolution and is still simple enough to run that fast? Or at least only maybe 10
times slower? What **are** the necessary components for language evolution?
