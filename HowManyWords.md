# How many words are there in a language?

How many words are there in a language? How big is its lexicon? How can we even
count that? If the language we wonder about is a written language which marks
word boundaries in its writing system (each of these conditions excludes a large
number of languages, but let's start with an ‘easy’ case) we have a way in: We
take a corpus – a collection of works in the language – and start counting.
