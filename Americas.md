# Settlement of the Americas

Some 18'000 years ago – or maybe more than 30'000 years ago, it's actually a hot
topic of research – people moved from Siberia across the Bering strait or the
Beringia land bridge (depending on when it actually happened and how the sea
levels looked then) into Alaska and then on across the Americas. There were
likely several migrations. (And backmigrations, and internal migrations after
ice shields melted, and so on.) A few thousands of years later, just 400 years
ago, the Americas showed an immense linguistic diversity, and some of that
survived the onslaught of European colonization. Today, we count more 200
language families and [isolated languages](Isolates.md) in the Americas.

How does such language diversity arise? How do you go from speaking a single
language, several thousands of years ago, to several thousands of languages
today? This question is of course not limited to the Americas. But there are
only very few places in the world where we see it to this extreme and without
clear evidence that humans made it there +before*. In addition, many other
spreads of people and expansions of language families are thought to be driven
by some new technology (eg. rice cultivation, navigation, horseriding). Our
assumption (which may say more about us than about them) is that the settlement
of the Americas, by contrast, was driven by the opening of the landscape – ice
melting, land bridges, temperatures rising to make land habitable, or some
combination thereof.
