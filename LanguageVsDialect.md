# Languages or Dialects?

Why are X any Y considered two different languages, while A and B are both considered dialects of C?

Political reasons (Weinreich: “a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot”)
Mutual intelligibility – measured how?

Data driven estimation of a “number” of German languages

Maybe Søren's paper on distances, expanded using current methods?
